## Introduction 
Many of us do not have a lot of time anymore. The worst thing is to pick up a book, waste hours reading it only to waste time that you will never get back. The solution is Book Ends. Book Ends is a webpage that works like a social media app. Users will have the ability to sign in and discuss books that they have read or could possibly be intereested in. Users will have the ability to post thoughts and reactions to comments surrounding books that have been mentioned. If it hasn't been mentioned, create a thread. The site will also allow users to review books that may be available from Google Books.
